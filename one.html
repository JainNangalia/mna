            <p>
                It has been long since I wrote you something, 
                and it is not like I always do but today just 
                felt like the day to do it. Manya, I know I get mad, 
                and act crazy sometimes, and I am really annoying, 
                and I always want to piss you off, and sometimes 
                I am really out of pocket. 
                
                </br></br>

                But fortunately, today is not about that. Today is about every 
                day I have spent with you in the last 5 months. And honestly, 
                it is crazy that it is already five months. 
                It is like we met yesterday. I still remember the day you 
                walked into that restaurant sitting across me, flirting with me 
                which you blame on your hangover. It does not matter, 
                cause if you didn’t, maybe I would’ve. Or maybe I did. 
                
                </br></br>
                
                But what does matter is that I could fight with you like this 
                all day, I could joke with you like this all day, or I could 
                tell you how much you mean to me, like I am right now, all day. 
                Truth is Manya at this point I am just use to you. Honestly, 
                you are the dream I never had. Remember, how you said you were 
                scared what if I would leave? You know I thought about it, 
                because you also said this is different. We might have a 
                thousand reasons not to be with each other, but you know what 
                Manu, you make that one reason count more than any other reason 
                and that is I love you more than I could love anything or 
                anyone in this world. 

                </br></br>
                
                You’ve no idea how much different my life is with you, and 
                how much worse it would be without you. You’re right this is 
                the last time even I am trying to love anyone, but if not with 
                you, I don’t know if I want it to be anyone else. Happy 1 Month.
